// I had problems getting mouse movement events working in ncurses, but after
// some research, it seems as if this is how you can do it. The magic is in the
// printf("\033[?1003h\n") which was the missing piece in the puzzle for me
// (see console_codes(4) for more information). 1003 means here that all events
// (even position updates) will be reported.
//
// This seems to work in at least three X-based terminals that I've tested:
// xterm, urxvt and gnome-terminal. It doesn't work when testing in a "normal"
// terminal, with GPM enabled. Perhaps something for the next gist version? :)
